Chef Email of the Week

Suzanne sent us this:

  I have recently learned that I am allergic to wheat, dairy, eggs and soy.  I am looking for a meal service that can assist me in tackling the challenge of living with these allergies, as well as serving delicious meals to the rest of my family.  Is your program able to help me, or is this too extreme??

Chef response:
Hello Suzanne,

  Thanks so much for your interest in Everything but the Chef. Our service helps with the challenges of meal planning, organization and shopping. Our mission is to give families the best chance at having regular family meals.

  Unfortunately, at this time we do not cater to any special dietary requirements, however we are mindful of the needs of customers and constantly updating our service. You never know what the future may hold. Please check back with us often!

  Please note that our service can be very popular with families that have an individual on a special diet that the other members of the family won't eat. With Chef at least the planning for one of the family meals is all done. Please keep this in mind and best wishes in finding what you're looking for.

Best to you,

Chef
