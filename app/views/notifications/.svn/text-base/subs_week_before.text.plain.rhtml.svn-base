Great News from Everything but the Chef!


We are happy to announce that in just one week we are rolling out the new and improved "Everything but the Chef," a meal planning service that makes YOU look GOOD! We have simplified our service, drastically reduced the price, and are extending a special member only invitation to come join us. Look for sign-up details next week, and most importantly learn how you can easily get the entire Chef service absolutely FREE!

Our members will still receive a weekly email reminder that five new, complete meal plans (every week of the year) are ready--and they're FLEXIBLE to meet your unique family needs! The email will always include a fabulous family treat recipe, and Chef  information in an email of the week. 

Let us help you save time and money while creating lasting family memories that will prove priceless and timeless. 

Look for a special invitation in your inbox next week and be sure to sign up, log-in and join the fastest growing meal planning community on the web AND find out right away how easy it is to get the service completely FREE!
