Greetings to you from Everything but the Chef,

We are happy to inform you that Chef  has gone through some very cool changes! Our service is being enhanced, and from now on you will be billed at a rate that is more than a 50% savings (only $4.95 a month) over what you are currently paying. If you are a yearly subscriber you just received an additional year of service! Most importantly, it’s easy to get Chef absolutely FREE. Log into your chef account now to learn how! http://ebtchef.com/

After gathering information from an online survey it was determined that “simplifying” our service was one of the best things we could do. We will no longer be offering the Cook’n software or the weekly newsletter.

The great news is that our meal plans will now be flexible! That’s right, it will now be easier to meet the individual needs of YOUR family. Customers will be able to save “favorite” recipes from Chef meal plans and replace unwanted recipes in the future with these favorites.  You can also delete recipes if desired, and all this can be done with a shopping list that reflects your changes!! In the near future we hope to offer customers the ability to save their personal favorite recipes in the favorites file and incorporate these into meal plans also. We’re constantly improving things and trying to meet the needs of our customers because we believe in family and see regular family mealtime as a powerful thing that promotes happy, healthy families.

Our new site will eventually include many Enriching Family Life Tips—activities, stories and fun, for you to enjoy. Members will receive a weekly email that serves as a reminder that new meal plans have been posted. This email will include a fabulous family treat recipe, and a Chef email of the week. And don’t forget, you can get our service absolutely FREE! Log in to Chef to find out just how easy it is.

Thanks for your patience as we completed our latest and greatest version of Everything but the Chef. Continued Best to You in Your Cooking Adventures,

Chef
