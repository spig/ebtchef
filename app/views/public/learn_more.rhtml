  <h2>Strong Evidence That Eating Together Will Strengthen Your Family</h2>

  <h4>Is having regular Family meals together that big a deal?</h4>
  <p class="quote">
  "Study after study finds that kids who eat dinner with their families regularly are better students, healthier people, and less likely to smoke, drink, or use drugs than those who don't. A University of Michigan study of children ages 3 through 12, for example, found that more meal time with the family was the single strongest predictor of better achievement scores and few behavioral problems" in school.

  <h2>Thoughts from Chef</h2>
  <p>
  I love my children. As they grow up and leave home I find great joy and comfort in the fond memories of wonderful talks, and many laughs shared around our kitchen table as we ate meals together. My six children chose to be involved in different sports, clubs, after school programs, church and community service organizations, etc. It was not easy to find a time to have a meal together! It had to be our top priority <span style="font-style: italic;">(with few exceptions).</span>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
  No one can argue with the fact that the world needs help &#8212; what can we do? Families need to spend time together, and setting a tradition of regular mealtime makes this happen. It's NOT easy, but it's worth it more than you will ever realize, until it's either too late, or you are reaping benefits you wouldn't trade for anything. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
  Within the family, happy, responsible, moral individuals motivated to do good things can be the outcome if parents keep family their priority. What other unit of society can make as strong a claim, or offer a better chance for this? <span style="color: #404040; font-weight: bold;">Everything but the Chef helps families get back to the basics that foster strong family relationships.</span>
