<h2>Going East</h2>
<div class="writings">
Several years ago my husband and I took our kids on a trip back East. Being "westerners" that's how you refer to traveling toward the "right coast." We did it in an effort to expand the kids horizonsâ€”help them see more than just "life as they knew it to be." It worked, and we had a fun time to boot. In brief, here's what we did during our 17-day summer time journey. <br />
 <br />
We flew to Toronto, in Ontario, Canada. In a rented mini van we took a couple days to see things around that city, such as the top of the CN Tower (tallest space needle). My boys were thrilled with that but not as thrilled as they were with a guided tour of the Skydome, and later watching the Blue Jays play the Twins in that awesome facility. <br />
 <br />
We drove to New York after our stay in Toronto, and visited some LDS (Mormon) historical sites in the Palmyra (New York) area, as well as attending their famous "Hill Cumorah Pageant" near Manchester, which we enjoyed immensely. After what my kids would call the "calm" part of the trip, we headed for New York City, and found it to be anything but dull.  <br />
 <br />
Perhaps the thing my children talk about most in their reminiscences of the trip, is just our drive around the BIG city, and all the "honking"! They saw and heard things they never had before (windows rolled down on purpose to hear, and then rolled up on purpose, to feel safe). It has meant some lively discussion since then, in recalling memories of those couple days. While there we went atop the then standing World Trade Center, and the Statue of Liberty. We did some shopping, and when finished with our plans in the big city, we headed to Harrisburg, PA, where my father lived at the time. <br />
 <br />
The kids really enjoyed a break from some of the rush, rush schedule we had kept since our trip began. While in Harrisburg we visited the famous Hersheypark where we touredthe chocolate factory, and visited the amusement park, sports arena, and gardens. It is just12 miles east of Harrisburg. Another day we went to Gettysburg, about 40 miles south,and a little west. It was a great experience for the kids to see where one of the mostimportant battles of the Civil War took place.<br />
 <br />
After re-fueling our personal batteries, due to a little slower pace at grandpa's, we headed for Washington D.C. where we saw the memorials, monuments, many of the Smithsonian museums, and Arlington cemetery. Nothing can beat that as a great history lesson for the kids, and an opening to discussions on how we feel about this great land of ours: the many sacrifices made so that we can enjoy opportunities and freedom unmatched anywhere.  <br />
 <br />
On our final leg of the trip we drove to Niagara Falls to take in a truly magnificent wonder of nature that you can view up close from a boat that takes you near the bottom of the Falls. The little kids thought the blue raincoats, to keep them dry from the spray, were cool (the older ones hesitated putting them on). From here we drove back to Toronto where we caught our flight home. In one way we were exhausted, but in another way rejuvenated, and definitely better for having had the experience.<br />
 <br />
This is a brief description of the tiny piece of the East that we took in, but it was enough to whet our appetites, and some of us have been back a couple times since then.
